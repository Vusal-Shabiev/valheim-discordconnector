# Messages.Events

::: tip Available Predefined Variables (Events)
In the event messages, anywhere in the message you can use the string vars `%EVENT_START_MSG%` and `%EVENT_END_MSG%` (or `%EVENT_MSG%` which is uses the start message when the event starts and the end message when the event ends.) You can also use `%POS%` which will be replaced with their position if the position toggle is enabled.

:::details Random Messages
All of the message options support having multiple messages defined in a semicolon (`;`) separated list. If you have multiple messages defined for these settings, one gets chosen at random when DiscordConnector decides to send the corresponding message.

If you wanted to have a couple different messages for when a player dies (always chosen at random), you could simply set the config value like this:

```toml
Player Death Message = %PLAYER_NAME% has died a beautiful death!;%PLAYER_NAME% went to their end with honor!;%PLAYER_NAME% died.
```

::: details Available Custom Variables
These are defined in the [Custom Variables](/config/variables.html) config file.

`%VAR1%`, `%VAR2%`, `%VAR3%`, `%VAR4%`, `%VAR5%`, `%VAR6%`, `%VAR7%`, `%VAR8%`, `%VAR9%`, `%VAR10%`

::: warning Including the Event Position
If you enabled the position toggle is enabled for these messages but you do not include the `%POS%` variable, the position will be appended to the message (the default behavior before the addition of `%POS%`).
