:::details Random Messages
All of the message options support having multiple messages defined in a semicolon (`;`) separated list. If you have multiple messages defined for these settings, one gets chosen at random when DiscordConnector decides to send the corresponding message.

If you wanted to have a couple different messages for when a player dies (always chosen at random), you could simply set the config value like this:

```toml
Player Death Message = %PLAYER_NAME% has died a beautiful death!;%PLAYER_NAME% went to their end with honor!;%PLAYER_NAME% died.
```

::: tip
When using the `%POS%` variable, in a Ping message it will reflect the location that was pinged, not the player's location. If you enabled the position toggle is enabled for these messages but you do not include the `%POS%` variable, the position will be appended to the message (the default behavior before the addition of `%POS%`).
